The file provides a step-by-step guide on extracting data and integrating the code into a Jupyter Notebook using Postman. 
It covers inspecting a website, capturing network requests, extracting the cURL from an .aspx request, 
importing it into Postman, reviewing request details, generating Python code, and validating the response.

Extracting Data Like a Pro 🚀
1️⃣ Open & Inspect 🔍
- Fire up the website and hit Inspect Element.
- Dive into the HTML structure to see how things are built.

2️⃣ Network Sleuthing 🌐
- Switch to the Network tab in Developer Tools.
- Hunt for the .aspx request—this is where the magic happens.
- Copy the cURL request from the request details.

3️⃣ Postman Magic ✉️
- Open Postman and import the copied cURL.
- Check out the keys and values in the request payload.

4️⃣ Code Like a Boss 🐍
- Copy the Python code from Postman.
- Paste it into a Jupyter Notebook.

5️⃣ Run & Validate ✅
- Execute the request and check the response:
200 → Success! 🎉
400 → Oops! Bad Request 🚨

6️⃣ Make the Request Dynamic 🔄
Modify the payload to make it dynamic by changing the FromDate and ToDate values.
Example:
FromDate=01%2F02%2F2025&txtToDate=02%2F03%2F2025&btnSubmit=%20GO%20
This allows customization of the date range for analysis as per requirements.
